# Anti-Racist Archival Description Annotated Bibliography

The Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia (A4BLiP) Anti-Racist Description Working Group aims to provide archivists and other memory workers resources and a framework with which to approach description creation and revision. In particular, it seeks to address the othering and rendered invisibility of Black people in the archives, which persists today and continues to reinforce and normalize the white supremacist patriarchal society our archives reflect.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> New descriptive practices of underrepresented groups have in recent years been elevated to a national platform due to the work of cultural heritage practitioners and members of the public alike. La Tanya S. Autry, Curator of Art and Civil Rights at Mississippi Museum of Art created the [Social Justice and Museums Resource List](https://www.aam-us.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Social-Justice-Resources-for-Musuems.pdf); many archival repositories are partnering with underrepresented communities to build collections like the [Plateau Peoples’ Web Portal](https://plateauportal.libraries.wsu.edu/) and [Project STAND](https://standarchives.com/); and communities and activists are creating their own collections using digital humanities tools like the [Chicana por Mi Raza Digital Memory Collective](https://chicanapormiraza.org/), [DocNow](https://www.docnow.io/), [A People’s Archive of Police Violence in Cleveland](https://www.archivingpoliceviolence.org/), and the [Borderlands Archives Cartography](https://www.bacartography.org/). The A4BLiP Anti-Racist Description Working Group hopes to contribute to the archival community’s efforts to programmatically adopt ethical and inclusive description practices.

The citations included here represent a subset of titles selected from an extensive bibliography created and maintained by the Working Group. They focus on major  themes and issues found in recent literature on archives and librarianship that critique descriptive theory and practice, including the concept of provenance
and descriptive standards. These sources emphasize the role information professionals play and the power they wield in creating records, naming, and storytelling; and thus their participation in perpetuating, intentionally or not, oppressive structures and power dynamics. While the focus of this Working Group is to specifically address anti-Black description, the group attempted to include a number of resources on the ways in which archives oppress and erase through description and how archivists can change those practices. This meant including articles that do not focus specifically on Black experiences or collections, but that address other aspects of identity that have been erased in the archives. By doing so, our intention is not to collapse the various axes on which individuals experience oppression, often in intersecting ways. The group acknowledges that to experience oppression based on race is not the same as to experience oppression based on gender, sexuality, class, or ability, nor are any of these the same as experiencing oppression based on multiple identities at once. With this in mind, this bibliography includes some resources that are not specific to Black communities with the goal of seeking shared strategies, when appropriate, from those doing anti-oppressive description work in other areas.

white supremacist patriarchal society by erasing and othering marginalized groups.

At SAA 2017, a group of nine archivists delivered lightning talks and facilitated a dialogue in response to Michelle Caswell and Marika Cifor’s article “From Human Rights to Feminist Ethics: Radical Empathy in Archives.” Presentations touched on ethical collaboration and partnerships, secondary trauma and suspended grief, archival education and horizontal mentorship, vendor control of marginalized histories, and emotional labor, among other topics. The speakers collectively posited a fifth affective relationship, the relationship between archivist and archivist, in addition to the four outlined by Caswell and Cifor. While many of the talks were relevant to an ethical approach towards description, of particular relevance for this project is Holly Smith’s discussion of her work documenting the history of Black women at Spelman College, in which she provided strategies for how archivists can responsibly collaborate with and document diverse communities without co-opting their voices. Giordana Mecagni’s talk also critiqued institutions that purchase and digitize materials documenting the histories of Black, activist, and other marginalized communities only to keep them behind a paywall, arguing instead for decolonized digital archives that are accountable to the communities they document. Breakout session notes include strategies discussed by small groups about how to apply radical empathy and an ethics of care to various aspects of their work as archivists.

Berry presents a case study on a project undertaken at University of Minnesota Libraries to digitize and enhance description of African American materials through the aggregated Umbra Search African American History platform. She describes challenges surrounding locating materials related to African Americans, making decisions about whether to use problematic subject headings in order to support access, rights management, MPLP processing approaches, and the need to sometimes defy traditional archival description practices in order to appropriately contextualize materials within search aggregator displays. Berry’s case study also embodies a critique of the archival principle of provenance: she notes, the “digital landscape provides an opportunity to look at materials outside the context of their collections without having to physically re-order, disrupting concepts of respect des fonds which historically favor people with the power and privilege to securely store and collect materials over time.”

This article details the political choices archives, libraries, and museums wrestle with by providing examples of how national institutions have responded to the challenge of balancing ethical and moral questions surrounding the “politics of memory” with the more practical or “technical” concerns of operating a
cultural heritage center. Th e authors focus on the power structures that infl uence the library, archive, and museum (LAM) community of professionals and the daily activities of running such institutions, concluding that “technical activities always are political, at least latently or potentially, even when they are not contested and made explicitly political.” In the section on descriptive issues, Brown and Davis-Brown critique cataloging and classification systems for the ways in which they assume neutrality rather than accounting for the fact that they reflect dominant paradigms, as well as for their inability to keep up with cultural change. They also challenge LAM professionals to make “political choices” about “allocating resources to keep up with new paradigms by reclassifying older material, or to invest in gathering new material to be classifi ed according to the older system.”

In this article, Caswell discusses concrete ways in which archivists can recognize and work to dismantle white supremacy in the archives per a class exercise she developed for her students. In terms of descriptive practices, the author suggests several approaches, including archivists educating themselves about the
communities they describe; collaborating with communities to incorporate language they would use to describe themselves and compensating them for such work; hiring more archivists of color to do descriptive work; updating language in outdated finding aids and maintaining a record of such changes for review; hiring multi-linguists as archivists to author or translate fi nding aids into appropriate languages; and incorporating language courses in information science programs and as part of continuing education initiatives.

Caswell and Cifor state that social justice in the archives has been addressed only through a legal rightsbased framework, but insist that a feminist-ethics framework of care and connection should replace it. Th e concept of radical empathy -- a willingness to be aff ected and shaped by another’s experience without appropriating the experiences of others -- should inform archival decision-making. Through this model, archivists would acknowledge the “relationships of care” that they build with creators, subjects, and users of records, and would thoughtfully describe records based on what language the creator would use and how that language would affect communities invested in the record. The article asks the archival community to open itself to a theoretical shift in how we describe, how we appraise and accession, and in who we perceive as our users.

Cifor’s paper identifies and criticises the effective erasure of meaning and affect in the archives through the use of distant or removed language for description, especially when that language does not align with the intent and politics of a collection. In particular, Cifor discusses the ‘affect’ -- defined by Cifor as a force that creates a relationship, conscious or otherwise -- that description can create or remove, framing this around the description of hate mail in an LGBT collection. The items were described by Cifor in “the ways I believed a professional archivist should” rather than by how the community would experience and describe them. This description removed the aff ect a user would experience and apply to their understanding of a collection, creating a ‘false distance’, and potentially hiding these affects. Cifor offers some examples of queer community-based archival description that describes hate mail and indeed, hatred, in a way that account for the aff ect the material would have on creators and subjects. The article acknowledges that it is just a first step, and that many case studies that explore its concepts will be necessary in order to learn how to apply them to archival practice.
