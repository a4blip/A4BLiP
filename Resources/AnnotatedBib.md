# Anti-Racist Archival Description Annotated Bibliography

The Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia (A4BLiP) Anti-Racist Description Working Group aims to provide archivists and other memory workers resources and a framework with which to approach description creation and revision. In particular, it seeks to address the othering and rendered invisibility of Black people in the archives, which persists today and continues to reinforce and normalize the white supremacist patriarchal society our archives reflect.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> New descriptive practices of underrepresented groups have in recent years been elevated to a national platform due to the work of cultural heritage practitioners and members of the public alike. La Tanya S. Autry, Curator of Art and Civil Rights at Mississippi Museum of Art created the Social Justice and Museums Resource List; many archival repositories are partnering with underrepresented communities to build collections like the Plateau Peoples’ Web Portal and Project STAND; and communities and activists are creating their own collections using digital humanities tools like the Chicana por Mi Raza Digital Memory Collective, DocNow, A People’s Archive of Police Violence in Cleveland, and the Borderlands Archives Cartography. The A4BLiP Anti-Racist Description Working Group hopes to contribute to the archival community’s efforts to programmatically adopt ethical and inclusive description practices.

The citations included here represent a subset of titles selected from an extensive bibliography created and maintained by the Working Group. They focus on major  themes and issues found in recent literature on archives and librarianship that critique descriptive theory and practice, including the concept of provenance
and descriptive standards. These sources emphasize the role information professionals play and the power they wield in creating records, naming, and storytelling; and thus their participation in perpetuating, intentionally or not, oppressive structures and power dynamics. While the focus of this Working Group is to specifically address anti-Black description, the group attempted to include a number of resources on the ways in which archives oppress and erase through description and how archivists can change those practices. This meant including articles that do not focus specifically on Black experiences or collections, but that address other aspects of identity that have been erased in the archives. By doing so, our intention is not to collapse the various axes on which individuals experience oppression, often in intersecting ways. The group acknowledges that to experience oppression based on race is not the same as to experience oppression based on gender, sexuality, class, or ability, nor are any of these the same as experiencing oppression based on multiple identities at once. With this in mind, this bibliography includes some resources that are not specific to Black communities with the goal of seeking shared strategies, when appropriate, from those doing anti-oppressive description work in other areas.

white supremacist patriarchal society by erasing and othering marginalized groups.
