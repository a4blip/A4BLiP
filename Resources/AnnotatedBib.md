# Anti-Racist Archival Description Annotated Bibliography

The Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia (A4BLiP) Anti-Racist Description Working Group aims to provide archivists and other memory workers resources and a framework with which to approach description creation and revision. In particular, it seeks to address the othering and rendered invisibility of Black people in the archives, which persists today and continues to reinforce and normalize the white supremacist patriarchal society our archives reflect.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> New descriptive practices of underrepresented groups have in recent years been elevated to a national platform due to the work of cultural heritage practitioners and members of the public alike. La Tanya S. Autry, Curator of Art and Civil Rights at Mississippi Museum of Art created the [Social Justice and Museums Resource List](https://www.aam-us.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Social-Justice-Resources-for-Musuems.pdf); many archival repositories are partnering with underrepresented communities to build collections like the [Plateau Peoples’ Web Portal](https://plateauportal.libraries.wsu.edu/) and [Project STAND](https://standarchives.com/); and communities and activists are creating their own collections using digital humanities tools like the [Chicana por Mi Raza Digital Memory Collective](https://chicanapormiraza.org/), [DocNow](https://www.docnow.io/), [A People’s Archive of Police Violence in Cleveland](https://www.archivingpoliceviolence.org/), and the [Borderlands Archives Cartography](https://www.bacartography.org/). The A4BLiP Anti-Racist Description Working Group hopes to contribute to the archival community’s efforts to programmatically adopt ethical and inclusive description practices.

The citations included here represent a subset of titles selected from an extensive bibliography created and maintained by the Working Group. They focus on major  themes and issues found in recent literature on archives and librarianship that critique descriptive theory and practice, including the concept of provenance
and descriptive standards. These sources emphasize the role information professionals play and the power they wield in creating records, naming, and storytelling; and thus their participation in perpetuating, intentionally or not, oppressive structures and power dynamics. While the focus of this Working Group is to specifically address anti-Black description, the group attempted to include a number of resources on the ways in which archives oppress and erase through description and how archivists can change those practices. This meant including articles that do not focus specifically on Black experiences or collections, but that address other aspects of identity that have been erased in the archives. By doing so, our intention is not to collapse the various axes on which individuals experience oppression, often in intersecting ways. The group acknowledges that to experience oppression based on race is not the same as to experience oppression based on gender, sexuality, class, or ability, nor are any of these the same as experiencing oppression based on multiple identities at once. With this in mind, this bibliography includes some resources that are not specific to Black communities with the goal of seeking shared strategies, when appropriate, from those doing anti-oppressive description work in other areas.

white supremacist patriarchal society by erasing and othering marginalized groups.

At SAA 2017, a group of nine archivists delivered lightning talks and facilitated a dialogue in response to Michelle Caswell and Marika Cifor’s article “From Human Rights to Feminist Ethics: Radical Empathy in Archives.” Presentations touched on ethical collaboration and partnerships, secondary trauma and suspended grief, archival education and horizontal mentorship, vendor control of marginalized histories, and emotional labor, among other topics. The speakers collectively posited a fifth affective relationship, the relationship between archivist and archivist, in addition to the four outlined by Caswell and Cifor. While many of the talks were relevant to an ethical approach towards description, of particular relevance for this project is Holly Smith’s discussion of her work documenting the history of Black women at Spelman College, in which she provided strategies for how archivists can responsibly collaborate with and document diverse communities without co-opting their voices. Giordana Mecagni’s talk also critiqued institutions that purchase and digitize materials documenting the histories of Black, activist, and other marginalized communities only to keep them behind a paywall, arguing instead for decolonized digital archives that are accountable to the communities they document. Breakout session notes include strategies discussed by small groups about how to apply radical empathy and an ethics of care to various aspects of their work as archivists.

Berry presents a case study on a project undertaken at University of Minnesota Libraries to digitize and enhance description of African American materials through the aggregated Umbra Search African American History platform. She describes challenges surrounding locating materials related to African Americans, making decisions about whether to use problematic subject headings in order to support access, rights management, MPLP processing approaches, and the need to sometimes defy traditional archival description practices in order to appropriately contextualize materials within search aggregator displays. Berry’s case study also embodies a critique of the archival principle of provenance: she notes, the “digital landscape provides an opportunity to look at materials outside the context of their collections without having to physically re-order, disrupting concepts of respect des fonds which historically favor people with the power and privilege to securely store and collect materials over time.”

This article details the political choices archives, libraries, and museums wrestle with by providing examples of how national institutions have responded to the challenge of balancing ethical and moral questions surrounding the “politics of memory” with the more practical or “technical” concerns of operating a
cultural heritage center. Th e authors focus on the power structures that infl uence the library, archive, and museum (LAM) community of professionals and the daily activities of running such institutions, concluding that “technical activities always are political, at least latently or potentially, even when they are not contested and made explicitly political.” In the section on descriptive issues, Brown and Davis-Brown critique cataloging and classification systems for the ways in which they assume neutrality rather than accounting for the fact that they reflect dominant paradigms, as well as for their inability to keep up with cultural change. They also challenge LAM professionals to make “political choices” about “allocating resources to keep up with new paradigms by reclassifying older material, or to invest in gathering new material to be classifi ed according to the older system.”

In this article, Caswell discusses concrete ways in which archivists can recognize and work to dismantle white supremacy in the archives per a class exercise she developed for her students. In terms of descriptive practices, the author suggests several approaches, including archivists educating themselves about the
communities they describe; collaborating with communities to incorporate language they would use to describe themselves and compensating them for such work; hiring more archivists of color to do descriptive work; updating language in outdated finding aids and maintaining a record of such changes for review; hiring multi-linguists as archivists to author or translate fi nding aids into appropriate languages; and incorporating language courses in information science programs and as part of continuing education initiatives.

Caswell and Cifor state that social justice in the archives has been addressed only through a legal rightsbased framework, but insist that a feminist-ethics framework of care and connection should replace it. Th e concept of radical empathy -- a willingness to be aff ected and shaped by another’s experience without appropriating the experiences of others -- should inform archival decision-making. Through this model, archivists would acknowledge the “relationships of care” that they build with creators, subjects, and users of records, and would thoughtfully describe records based on what language the creator would use and how that language would affect communities invested in the record. The article asks the archival community to open itself to a theoretical shift in how we describe, how we appraise and accession, and in who we perceive as our users.

Library Trends 64, no. 4 (2016): 756-775, https://muse.jhu.edu/.**

Cifor’s paper identifies and criticises the effective erasure of meaning and affect in the archives through the use of distant or removed language for description, especially when that language does not align with the intent and politics of a collection. In particular, Cifor discusses the ‘affect’ -- defined by Cifor as a force that creates a relationship, conscious or otherwise -- that description can create or remove, framing this around the description of hate mail in an LGBT collection. The items were described by Cifor in “the ways I believed a professional archivist should” rather than by how the community would experience and describe them. This description removed the aff ect a user would experience and apply to their understanding of a collection, creating a ‘false distance’, and potentially hiding these affects. Cifor offers some examples of queer community-based archival description that describes hate mail and indeed, hatred, in a way that account for the aff ect the material would have on creators and subjects. The article acknowledges that it is just a first step, and that many case studies that explore its concepts will be necessary in order to learn how to apply them to archival practice.

Douglas urges archivists to be more transparent about how collections are constructed including information about a collection’s history as well as the intellectual and physical arrangement imposed upon it by creators and archivists. She notes that archivists have largely failed to make visible suffi cient information about the evolution and construction of collections, especially their own interpretive role, due to “conventions in archival theory and practice that encourage archivists to present a more perfect picture of the fonds, one that is consistent with traditional notions of archives as impartial and natural and of archivists as objective and neutral.” She also notes how the standardization of description has lent itself to “deceptive simplicity,” arguing that it contributes to the passive, neutral tone of fi nding aids. To counter this issue, the author suggests including information about the constructedness of collections, including the archivist’s role in fi nding aids by utilizing custodial history and arrangement notes, and/or in supplemental documentation or “parallel texts” such as essays, footnotes, appendices, and colophons. She suggests archivists make better use of and prioritize existing descriptive standards or perhaps revise existing content standards to add new elements that allow for more robust and visible information about the history, or life cycle, of collections. Douglas also suggests archivists avoid using passive voice.

In this article, Drabinski uses queer theory to critique a corrective approach to addressing problematic cataloging and classification issues. She encourages pedagogical interventions by librarians to help users interpret and critique these structures for themselves and other “queer interventions” that “highlight and make visible the contingency of cataloging decisions.” This article could be read as an argument for why it is important to retain a record of old terms and biased description even as society progresses, so users can understand how language evolves and how bias was perpetuated over time.

In this presentation, Drake critiques the concept of provenance (respect des fonds) and argues that due to its origins in 19th-century Western society-defined by colonialism, imperialism, and patriarchy-the principle is fraught with such biases and stuck in these narrowly-defined and elitist constructs. He emphasizes how technology, in particular the prevalence of born-digital records, is highlighting the limits of provenance in terms of shared creation and custody of documentation in the technical sense; and in a social sense, providing opportunities for individuals who previously did not have the ability to create records and name themselves. Drake argues that continued reliance on and adherence to this flawed and antiquated principle as a central tenet of archival practice and description entrenches the profession in colonialist, racist, and sexist practices. He calls for the development of new archival principle(s) to guide archival practice and description, and urges that this development occur “beyond the bounds of the archival profession” using an intersectional approach. He suggests that description should not be conducted in a top-down/colonialist manner; instead, this work should be more collaborative where creators are able to describe themselves and their records, and assert their own names or not.

http://yalearchivalreadinggroup.pbworks.com/f/Duff&Harris.pdf.**

Duff and Harris call for a liberatory, creative, and flexible approach to archival description, one that moves beyond fonds and series-based systems, the two primary descriptive architectures, which the authors conclude are limited and insufficient. Taking a decidedly postmodernist view, they encourage archivists to acknowledge their inherent subjectivity as actors of a particular place and time and their role as records creators. These realities speak to the power archivists have wielded in purposefully or inadvertently perpetuating and replicating oppressive power relations through the records and stories they help preserve and narrate; records and stories, the authors contend, that are continually constructed. Duff and Harris encourage archivists to critique and
problematize the basic tenets and concepts of the profession, in particular provenance and standardization and how they contribute to the inability of archivists to move beyond the violence that current archival practice perpetuates. They conclude that a new approach to archival description should be one “hospitable to deconstruction,” that does the following: prioritizes transparency where archival intervention, archivists’ biases, and the use of records are documented; takes all categories of users and their needs into account allows users to contribute their own stories; encourages archivists’ engagement with marginalized and silenced communities; interrogates its own “de facto functioning as a medium of metanarrative.”

**Dunbar, Anthony W. “Introducing Critical Race Theory to Archival Discourse: Getting the Conversation Started.” Archival Science 6. no.1 (March 2006): 109-129, doi.org/10.1007/s10502-006-9022-6.**

Dunbar focuses on three Critical Race Theory (CRT) methodological concepts: counterstories/counternarrative, microaggressions, and social justice. These concepts can guide the archival profession by teaching archivists to identify bias within a record’s content, context, and structure. This theory framework would challenge archivists to recognize who fills the roles of documenter vs. documented, and understand the power and agency that comes along with each role. When applying CRT to archival practice, archivists should identify culturally-constructed categories and build a counternarrative; recognize microaggressions in collections and interpretation; and actively bring multiple perspectives to the forefront of archival discourse.

**Fuentes, Marisa J. *Dispossessed Lives: Enslaved Women, Violence, and the Archive.* Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2016.**

In her book, Marisa Fuentes takes archival fragments of stories of enslaved women in Barbados, most specifi cally in Bridgetown, and reconstructs them. Th rough these reconstructions, she explores the ways in which archives silence Black women’s voices and presence in history and keep them hidden underneath a dominant white imperialist narrative reinforced by the historical record. Fuentes delves into these archival fragments to reveal the violence and control visited upon enslaved Black women in an urban context, and models how we should read past the white male narrative and look for the architecture of oppression on Black women revealed in the record fragments -- and understand their choices and lives based on that context.
