# Introduction

Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS), the archives profession’s content standard, empowers archivists “to develop and document a description policy based on specific local knowledge and consistent application of professional judgement.”<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> [Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia (A4BLiP)](https://archivesforblacklives.wordpress.com/), as part of its commitment to anti-oppression values, especially our commitment to critically examine archival theory and practice, has compiled research and case studies created by archivists across the field into a set of best practice recommendations for an anti-oppressive approach to creating and remediating archival description. While there is no single set of recommendations that can address racism within archival description, we hope that this document will help synthesize and elevate important work archivists are doing surrounding ethical and anti-oppressive description. We urge our colleagues to hire and promote Black archivists and support Black students interested in archival careers through providing funded educational opportunities and paid internships with pathways to permanent positions, in addition to these best practices. A profession with more Black archivists will be a profession better equipped to create ethical, respectful, and accurate description of records created by and about Black people.<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> While the following recommendations focus on Black communities, they can, in many cases, be applied more broadly to the description of records created by and about marginalized communities. 

A4BLiP encourages white archivists and non-Black archivists of color who are combatting anti-Black archival description to first take time to familiarize yourself with anti-oppressive terms, concepts, and norms in order to deconstruct the white supremacist values that permeate American society, and by extension, the archival field.<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup> Some helpful resources include:
