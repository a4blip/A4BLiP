# Metadata Recommendations

We acknowledge the reality that individual processing archivists may not have the authority to apply all of the methods described here. The following recommendations include those that are actionable in the day-to-day process of descriptive work, as well as those that require advocating for and implementing broader institutional changes at an administrative level. We encourage readers to take action where they can.<sup>[5](#myfootnote5)</sup>

<a name="myfootnote5">[5]</a> Thank you to Dorothy Berry for encouraging us to consider the difference between guidelines, recommendations, and manifestos, as well as the power required to implement institutional change. 

## Voice and Style

* Unlearn the “neutral” voice of traditional archival description.<sup>[6](#myfootnote6)</sup> Rather than striving for an “objective” voice, which reinforces existing power structures, base description in the question (as posed by Michelle Caswell and Marika Cifor): “Is the descriptive language I am using respectful to the larger communities of people invested in this record?”<sup>[7](#myfootnote7)</sup> Decenter “neutrality” and “objectivity” in favor of “respect” and “care.”<sup>[8](#myfootnote8)</sup>
* Avoid passive voice (or passive language in linked data predicates<sup>[9](#myfootnote9)</sup>) when describing oppressive relationships. Use active voice in order to embed responsibility within description. For example, consider the difference between these two sentences: 
  * “Four Kent State University students were killed on May 4, 1970, during a clash between the Ohio National Guard and a crowd gathered to protest the Vietnam War.”
  * “Members of the Ohio National Guard killed four Kent State University students during a mass protest against the Vietnam War.”

* Focus on the humanity of an individual before their identity/ies: 
  * For example, consider the difference between “documents the business dealings of a Black woman named Maria in 18th century Mexico” and “documents the business dealings of Maria, a Black woman in 18th century Mexico.”<sup>[10](#myfootnote10)</sup>
* Refrain from writing flowery, valorizing biographical notes for collection creators.<sup>[11](#myfootnote11)</sup> Evaluate existing biographical notes, especially those describing white males, for aggrandizing language and remove it.<sup>[12](#myfootnote12)</sup>
* Remove and refrain from including evaluative terms like “preeminent,” “renowned,” “genius,” or “seminal” that serve to praise collection creators. Ask yourself: Does including this piece of  information help users better understand the collection, or is it there only to justify the collection creator’s stature?
  * Excerpt from a “what not to do” example: “In addition to his work as a lawyer, Hays wrote an astounding number of books and articles. As a gifted writer and eloquent debater, he added his perspective to virtually every individual rights issue of his day. His autobiography, entitled City Lawyer: the Autobiography of a Law Practice (1942), provides a colorful account of his more noteworthy cases, and his articles and book reviews demonstrate his wide-ranging knowledge of a nation and a world experiencing dramatic change in the way individual rights were perceived.”<sup>[13](#myfootnote13)</sup>
* Use accurate and strong language such as lynching, rape, murder, and hate mail when they are appropriate. Do not let your discomfort with the terms censor the material. It is okay to be uncomfortable with racist material. It is not okay to privilege your discomfort above accurate description.
* Describe relationships of power when they are important for understanding the context of records. Racism, slurs, white supremacy, colonialism, and histories of oppression are important context.
  * For example, “Thomas Jefferson was a known enslaver despite his legacy as a supporter of individual rights.”

## Community Collaboration and Expanding Audiences

Expand the range of audiences considered when writing archival description to include a plurality of audiences. Evaluate local descriptive practices and policies using the criteria: Which audiences does this description center? Which audiences does it exclude?

* For academic archives, this could look like making description more comprehensible for undergraduates, genealogists/family historians, and local community members. For archives collecting Spanish-language material, this could mean considering whether English-language finding aids are serving users. This could also look like minimizing archival jargon.

* For academic archives, reach out to institutional scholars who have expertise in relevant subject areas to get input on description.<sup>[14](#myfootnote14)</sup>

* Describe records in a way that supports the information-seeking needs of stakeholder communities, not just academic scholars.

  * Develop and maintain relationships with community members/stakeholders in order to learn language that the audience recognizes and uses to refer to itself.<sup>[15](#myfootnote15)</sup>

  * Consider the needs of family historians and genealogists who may not be seeking “a fact or date, but to create a larger narrative, connect with others in the past and in the present, and to find coherence in one’s own life;”<sup>[16](#myfootnote16)</sup> provide opportunities for genealogists and other researchers who may want to “give back” by contributing description or connect socially with one another.<sup>[17](#myfootnote17)</sup>

  * (Re-)describers should be empathetic towards those who may have emotional ties to people  documented in records. Be careful about language choice and center the humanity of people documented in the records.

  * Take into account potential human rights uses of records, as well as the interests of survivors of abuses. This involves avoiding the inclusion of information or linkages that could put living persons at risk, providing descriptions in languages used by stakeholder communities, and creating metadata about the intentional destruction or accidental preservation of records, which could be mobilized as evidence in human rights proceedings.<sup>[18](#myfootnote18)</sup>

* Consider the option of not naming people should they decide to withhold naming or if naming them could cause harm. For highly surveilled and dispossessed communities, visibility can be a form of violence. The harm that is inflicted on Black communities, which in many cases are human rights abuses, is not always evident to those outside of those communities.<sup>[19](#myfootnote19)</sup>

* When drafting archivist-supplied description and notes,<sup>[20](#myfootnote20)</sup> use terminology that Black people use to describe themselves, while recognizing that the Black community is not a monolith, and different people will have different and sometimes conflicting preferences. Be mindful that terminology changes over time, so description will be an iterative process.<sup>[21](#myfootnote21)</sup>

  * For living collection creators or subjects, ask them for their preference.

  * Observe and take cues from the language of current historians, writers, artists, and others who are from (or descended from), specialize in, and have working relationships with the particular communities you’re describing.<sup>[22](#myfootnote22)</sup> For older records, this means consulting with experts who are knowledgeable about specific communities existing in a certain place and point in time.

  * When consulting with community members, be mindful of individual biases; and make an effort to not solely rely on one voice or representative from a particular community. One method for gathering more representative feedback could involve a peer or community review process.<sup>[23](#myfootnote23)</sup>

  * If you ask people from marginalized communities to help with description, be respectful of their time/labor and provide compensation. Do your homework first, and don’t ask others to provide information you can easily find yourself. Pay them for their work.

* Consult alternative cataloging schemes created by the subjects of the records being described when and if they are available, and cite them in a processing note or other part of the finding aid. As noted above, Black people are not monolithic, and care should be taken when consulting alternative classification schemes to ensure that the schemes consulted truly represent and apply to the community the archivist is describing.<sup>[24](#myfootnote24)</sup>

* Make sure institution-created description is assessed by outside communities.<sup>[25](#myfootnote25)</sup>

  * Provide a feedback mechanism such as creating a highly visible “Suggest a Correction” button or comment form on online finding aids, and make it clear that you welcome this kind of feedback.

  * Provide mechanisms for users to annotate finding aids.<sup>[26](#myfootnote26)</sup>

  * Organize focus groups with community members and incorporate feedback into archival description.
 
  * For description to be assessed by outside communities, it must be discoverable. If online finding aids are difficult to locate and access, or if description exists on websites that are hard to navigate, community members may be less likely to interact with them.<sup>[27](#myfootnote27)</sup>

* Ensure that Black individuals appear in name authority files, such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF) and Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC), which may involve collaborating with external communities, especially in cases where your institution lacks relevant expertise. Acknowledge that this will involve dedicating institutional and professional time and resources to co-organizing meetings and events with community members and/or providing cataloging or name authority work services if requested by communities.

* Be mindful of how individuals are described in authority records, and educate yourself and staff on compassionate and anti-oppressive creation of such records. As one example of harmful name authority creation, one institution associated the only known related date, 1832, with an enslaved individual -- the date that the institution itself had purchased him. By using “Fl. 1832” as a distinguishing characteristic, the institution was centering that transaction as the most significant event in the individual’s life.<sup>[28](#myfootnote28)</sup> Resource Description and Access (RDA) allows for more expanded differentiation methods for names, no longer limited to use of dates. Make use of events, places, occupations, and other known signifiers that humanize rather than dehumanize Black individuals.

* Acknowledge that any efforts by PWIs to collaborate with Black communities and institutions on description projects will require explicitly “addressing institutional legacies [of racism] at [these] predominantly white institutions.”<sup>[29](#myfootnote29)</sup> Additionally, it is important to acknowledge that the dominance of whiteness and white supremacy in archives and the library field goes beyond PWIs -- and that the work of helping to address and fix this imbalance of power may not be of primary importance to communities focused on their daily survival. Before reaching out to potential collaborators, institutional partners should be able to concretely articulate how projects will benefit participating communities rather than solely co-opting the knowledge of those communities for institutional gain. Finding ways to build trust and to contribute back to the communities in ways that help sustain their survival and goals should be part of the partnership. Once potential collaborators are engaged, institutional partners must remain open to projects changing and evolving based on the expressed needs of community partners.<sup>[30](#myfootnote30)</sup>

## Auditing Legacy Description and Reparative Processing

* Revisit legacy description to provide better name access for Black people where possible, including names of subjects as well as creators of records. Acknowledging the limits of provenance-based description,<sup>[31](#myfootnote31)</sup> describe the subjects of documents about oppressed or marginalized peoples at least to the extent that you describe the creators of documents. Consider the extent to which describing a person by name is an act of affirming humanity.<sup>[32](#myfootnote32)</sup>

* At the same time, when describing living creators or subjects, consider that over-description has thepotential to put people from groups already subject to inordinate amounts of surveillance<sup>[33](#myfootnote33)</sup> at greater risk. Whenever possible, consult the person(s) implicated before including personal information<sup>[34](#myfootnote34)</sup> thatcould possibly put them at risk.

* Audit past harmful description practices and implement taxonomic reparations when appropriate.<sup>[35](#myfootnote35)</sup> This might include:

  * Devoting the necessary time, staffing, and financial resources to remediate racist descriptive practices.
  
  * Taking the time to locate and describe hidden voices and to correct past failures to respectfully describe the histories of Black communities. Following a More Product, Less Process (MPLP) or iterative processing approach, this means considering past failures of care and the possibility of uncovering hidden voices among the factors for deciding when prioritizing which collections -- or portions of collections -- should receive work above and beyond baseline processing tiers.<sup>[36](#myfootnote36)</sup>
  
  * Integrating remediation of racist language in finding aids into regular legacy description cleanup projects.

  * When replacing racist terms from archivist-supplied description, refraining from removing entirely language that would help researchers discover Black subjects in archival collections, particularly in collections that are predominantly white<sup>[37](#myfootnote37)</sup> (i.e. do not simply delete the word “negro” without using a diff erent descriptor).
 
  * Paying attention to and removing racist physical descriptions of individuals and descriptions that inappropriately assign emotions or motives to subjects.<sup>[38](#myfootnote38)</sup>
  
  * When surfacing under-described records of marginalized groups, take care to make these records discoverable without further other-izing them or tokenizing people described in the records. For example, at Princeton, the Association of Princeton Puerto Rican Alumni Records were described in a large artificial collection of subject files. Archivists removed them from this collection and created a separate finding aid<sup>[39](#myfootnote39)</sup> for the records as appropriate for an organizational records collection.
 
* When updating racist language or contextualization in finding aids, always preserve a copy of previous description so that future researchers can explore the history of the finding aid,<sup>[40](#myfootnote40)</sup> as well as documentation of the rationale behind changes. Methods for doing this include:
  
  * Preserving old hard copies or PDFs of finding aids
  
  * Creating a publicly accessible collection of legacy finding aids
  
  * Making use of local tools for tracking processing documentation, which could include collection management software, physical or digital collection files, version control software and commit notes, or others, as available
  
  * Provide a note and/or link in the current finding aid that indicates the existence of legacy finding aids, why they were kept, and how to access them.

## Handling Racist Folder Titles and Creator-Sourced Description

* Consider your audience and the potential for harm when making decisions about whether to preserve problematic creator-supplied language. In most cases, preserve but contextualize creator-sourced original description when racism is an important context for understanding records.<sup>[41](#myfootnote41)</sup> If you choose to maintain some or all racist creator-based description, draw a distinction between the creator-supplied description and archivist-supplied description via quotation marks, processing information note, scope and content note, and/or another method. Other helpful actions may include:

  * Utilizing a series-level note explaining that creator-based folder titles were or were not maintained, recognizing that some language is outdated/offensive, and explaining WHY you chose to maintain or not maintain those labels. Creating standardized institutional language that can be reused may be helpful.
  
  * Recognizing that a processing note will not alone be sufficient to communicate to most users.
  
  * For collections or discovery portals where users may be harmed by encountering offensive language, it may be appropriate to replace offensive language in primary user-facing description. For an example of this approach, refer to the language policy for the Find & Connect website on child welfare in Australia.<sup>[42](#myfootnote42)</sup>
 
* Make a distinction between the institutional voice/archivist’s voice and the voice of the collection creator (ex. don’t use the same racist terms a creator may have used in folder titles in scope and content notes orother notes that are supplied by the archivist.)

* Research how the community being described feels about certain terms, and weigh MPLP-type re-use ofcreator description against the use of terms that are harmful. Finding other institutions that have grappled with similar collections may help. Where possible, speak directly with creators/subjects who may be harmed by legacy description to determine whether the language should be maintained or changed. In some cases, this research may not be possible, and even when making informed decisions about terminology, it is still possible to do harm.

## Describing Slavery Records

* Use “enslaved” or “captive” [person/woman/man/child/laborer] rather than “slave” when describing peopleheld in bondage. <a name="myfootnote43">[43]</a> Use “enslaver” to describe people who held others in bondage.<sup>[44](#myfootnote44)</sup>

* Avoid lumping the experiences of all people of African origins or descent in the early Americas together. Use “free [person|man|woman] of color” (often abbreviated as “f.p.c,” “f.m.c,” or “f.w.c” on documents),“freed[person|man|woman],” or another term to describe those who were not enslaved during a period when slavery existed in that society. Note that terminology differs depending on geographic location or language, and conduct research to avoid using anachronistic or geographically or linguistically inaccurate terms.<sup>[45](#myfootnote45)</sup>

* If you have item-level description for a deed of purchase for an enslaved person and the seller and purchaser’s names are included, include the name of the person being sold. Humanize these documents from all sides -- not just from the side of the creator.

* Use available information to name enslaved people; in most cases, this information will be incomplete. This means that describers may have to push past their discomfort in creating what the profession views as incomplete records or description.<sup>[46](#myfootnote46)</sup> Whenever possible, record names by which enslaved or formerly enslaved people identified as the primary part of the name rather than using an enslaver’s name as the primary entry. Enslavers’ names may be included as supplemental information to support the identification of enslaved individuals but should not supplant the names of enslaved people, even when only their first names are known.<sup>[47](#myfootnote47)</sup>

* Describe records of slavery such that the descriptions support the information-seeking practices of Black researchers and genealogists<sup>[48](#myfootnote48)</sup> investigating the histories of enslaved persons rather than focusing solely on the data points valued at the point of record creation.

 * In addition to providing more detailed finding aids, when possible, that include the names of enslaved persons, indicate the presence of enslaved people in both slavery-focused and non-slavery-focused collections, even when documentation is fragmentary. Even minimal descriptions can make enslaved historical subjects more discoverable to researchers and counter outdated assumptions that “the Black past is unknowable.”<sup>[49](#myfootnote49)</sup>
 
 * Link to finding aids and other resources at other institutions documenting the same enslavers, enslaved persons, and land.<sup>[50](#myfootnote50)</sup>
 
 * When determining whether to preserve original order or description for slavery collections, factor in the role record-keeping systems played in facilitating the slavery economy and consider whether there is a need to take mediating steps to support secondary use by persons dehumanized by the original functions of records and circumvent the “bureaucratic” logic of a repressive regime.<sup>[51](#myfootnote42)</sup> Mediating steps may include, but are certainly not limited to, additional description and extra effort to surface the names of enslaved persons in archival description and description that clearly identifies that records were kept to facilitate a repressive regime.

<a name="myfootnote45">[45]</a> See: Foreman et al., “Writing about Slavery:” “Avoid using ‘people of color’ as a blanket term when writing about Black people or other specific groups - unless you are referencing Cuba, where ‘gente de color’ was a legitimate term used by peoples of African descent in the nineteenth century.”

<a name="myfootnote47">[47]</a> This advice deviates from guidance given in: David E. Paterson, “A Perspective on Indexing Slaves’ Names,” American Archivist 64, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2001): 132–142, http://americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/aarc.64.1.th18g8t6282h4283. Especially since contemporary search systems support keyword searching of enslaver names that may be included in other parts of description, there is no reason to use ens  laver names as a primary entry when describing enslaved people. Although the working group read Paterson’s article while conducting research for this project, this article does not appear in the group’s bibliography because we do not feel that it advances the group’s mission of furthering anti-oppressive archival description.

## Subjects and Classification

* Do not rely on Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) exclusively when creating subject access points. Thoughtfully consult appropriate alternative classification schemes as described above in the Community Collaboration and Access section.<sup>[52](#myfootnote52)</sup>

* Consider avoiding LCSH terms if they are harmful to the people they describe. If you are uncertain, do research to determine whether the subject heading is considered harmful. If terms are not used, consider how this may affect access. Balance access with language usage thoughtfully. Consider working with groups such as the Cataloging Lab<sup>[53](#myfootnote53)</sup> to actively try to change harmful headings. 

* If you decide to use an LCSH subject heading that is harmful, explain why you have done this in the processing note. For example, you may choose to include a subject heading considered harmful so that you are able to provide access in the short term and update the heading when it is changed through the cooperative cataloging program.

## Transparency

* Description should acknowledge shortcomings with regards to collecting gaps, as well as institutional responsibility for creating those gaps.

  * Especially for collections a repository is responsible for assembling, describe the policies and practices that led to the current composition to the collection, and related gaps,<sup>[54](#myfootnote54)</sup> in the scope and content note.

  * Make collection development policies public and have them regularly reviewed by outside communities.

* Always include a processing information note so that researchers can see who described a collection and when. If descriptive language was updated to address racist terminology, indicate this in the processing note if it is not already indicated in other descriptive notes that users are more likely to encounter when navigating collection descriptions.

  * For example, while alerting users to the presence of problematic creator-supplied folder titles may be more appropriate in a series-level scope and content note, efforts to update subject headings and other collection-level processing decisions should be indicated in a collection-level processing note.

  * Also consider encoding processing notes at more granular levels of the finding aid, when applicable, to increase the likelihood that users will encounter them and avoid overly lengthy notes at the collection level.

* If your institution is systematically engaged in addressing racism in archival description and catalog   records, consider publishing an online statement outlining principles and goals.<sup>[55](#myfootnote55)</sup> If your institution is not already engaged in this work, advocate for initiating efforts to address racism in archival description, to the extent that you have the privilege and authority to do so; this can include advocating to publish a statement as a method of holding your institution accountable, integrating guidelines for addressing racist description into processing manuals, or other achievable interventions.
