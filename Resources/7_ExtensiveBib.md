This bibliography was created and maintained by the Anti-Racist Description Working Group of Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia (A4BLiP). While started as part of the process of researching methods for combating anti-Black archival description specifically, this bibliography includes sources on anti-oppressive approaches to description within the library, archives, and museums fields more broadly.
